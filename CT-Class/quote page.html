    <h1>WEEK 3</h1>
    <h2>QUOTE</h2>
    <p class="quote">1.The practicing writer, the writer-at-work, the writer im­mersed in his or her project, is not an entity at all, let alone a person, but some curious melange of wildly varying states of mind, clustered toward what might be called the darker end of the spectrum: indecision, frustration, pain, dismay, de­spair, remorse, impatience, outright failure. To be honored in midstream for one's labor would be ideal, but impossible;  
    </p>
    <p>
        This statement is very creative, magnifying the artist in the creation, focusing on thinking and spiritual world. These emotions are very real, and artists often draw the source of creation in pessimism and failure. A large number of accomplished artists (after they left) are in a less comfortable environment, and failures have created great works of art. The last sentence reflects the contradiction. If the respect is gained in the middle, the artwork may no longer be successful. Artists can achieve remarkable results under time pressure and survival pressure, but once they enter a relaxed environment, the value of their works begins to decline.
    </p>
    <p class="quote">2.Is the artist secretly in love with failure, one might ask. 
        Is there something dangerous about "success," something finite and limited and, in a sense, historical: the passing over from striving, and strife, to achievement?
    </p>
    <p>I believe that success does contain danger, and it may come from the'unknown'. There may not be a path to success, and you need to find it yourself. No one knows whether it is correct before reaching it. I guess it is because we often rely on the experience of our predecessors. If we don’t, we will not feel safe.</p>
    <p class="quote">3.Palinurus, a skillful pilot of the ship of Aeneas, fell into the sea in his sleep, was three days exposed to the tempests and waves of the sea, and at last came to the sea shore near Ve­lia, where the cruel inhabitants of the place murdered him to obtain his clothes: his body was left unburied on the sea­shore.         
    </p>
    <p>Quite like the declarative sentence.</p>
    <h1>WEEK 2</h1>
    <h2>QUOTE</h2>
    <p class="quote">1.“In 2016 a team at the University of Washington set out to create a deliberately faulty husky-versus-wolf classifier. Their goal was to test a new tool called LIME, which they’d designed to detect mistakes in classifier algorithms. They collected training images in which all the wolves were photographed against snowy backgrounds and all the husky dogs against grassy backgrounds. Sure enough, their classifier had trouble telling wolves from huskies in new images, and LIME revealed that it was indeed looking at the backgrounds rather than at the animals themselves.”  
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem of overfitting is very interesting. I think it is one of the most important problems in deep learning training. These examples of cheating machine learning are very common. I recently discovered that many captcha images have a lot of noise in the background. Although this does not confuse the human eye, it can effectively prevent robot image recognition. It also shows that AI is not looking at the object itself. AI may just separate objects from background.
    </p>
    <p class="quote">2.First, the team found a way to plot the word vector so that gender bias was visible—with male-associated words on the left and female-associated words on the right.
    </p>
    <p>I am very interested here. In some languages, words are divided into three attributes. What is the origin of this classification? He assigns male-associated to the left and female-associated to the right. Is this habit or accident? As far as I know, there are also sayings in China that men are on the left and women are on the right. Why are men on the left?</p>
    <p class="quote">3.How do we stop AIs from unintentionally copying human biases? One of the main things we can do is expect it to happen. We shouldn’t see AI decisions as fair just because an AI can’t hold a grudge. Treating a decision as impartial just because it came from an AI is known sometimes as mathwashing or bias laundering.        
    </p>
    <p>I agree with this point of view. The bias of AI algorithms comes from people. Perhaps better data collection or analysis methods can be applied, or AI can evolve itself to obtain an unbiased view.</p>
    <h1>WEEK 1</h1>
    <h2>QUOTE</h2>
    <p class="quote">1.Furthermore, digital products often have temporal logic where a linear narrative is replaced by a set of complex states and transitions.    
    </p>
    <p>
        I fully agree with this statement. When I was learning to design the interactive interface on the screen, I found that even for a few very simple pages, after considering different operation modes and user possibilities, there are many pages that need to be designed. , If you consider the transition between elements, the workload will be greater. When facing digital products, the consideration is no longer a page, but a timeline.

    <p class="quote">2.Perceptually uniform color spaces allow us to align numbers in our code with the visual effect perceived in our viewers.<br>
        In some cases, perceptually uniformity is essential. 
    </p>
    <p>The chapter where this part is located solves the problems I felt before. In the photos, I found that darker photos give people a stronger sense of layering, while photos with higher brightness or being overexposed give people a kind of The content on the photo feels squashed.</p>
    <p class="quote">3.The Brooklyn-based chocolate producer Mast Brothers is famous for their colorful packaging designs where colored patterns are used to denote the flavor profile of the chocolate.       
    </p>
    <p>I really like this packaging style, and the taste experience is conveyed visually, which feels great.</p>
