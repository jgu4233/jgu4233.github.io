<h1>Hi Welcome to Critical Tech!<br>
    WEEK1 WORK

    <b>I  Choose/find 3 less common (weird?) creative technology tools.</b><br>
    1.<a href="https://github.com/pvanallen/delft-ai-toolkit.git">Delft AI Toolkit</a><br>
    The Delft AI Toolkit provides a visual authoring environment that simplifies the use of machine learning, cognitive APIs, and other AI approaches.<br>
    2.<a href="https://color.adobe.com/explore">Adobe Color</a><br>
    A good website for color searching.<br>
    3.<a href="">
    <b>II  Choose/find 3 creative technology projects.</b>><br>
    1.<a href="https://www.teamlab.art/">teamLab</a><br>
    TeamLab is an art collective widely renowned in Japan for their immersive digital art exhibitions. The collective is composed of professionals from<br>
    various fields, not only in the arts, such as programmers, engineers, mathematicians, and architects.<br>
    2.<a href="https://nvlabs.github.io/few-shot-vid2vid/">The dancing David sculpture</a><br>
    Video-to-video synthesis (vid2vid) aims at converting an input semantic video, such as videos of human poses or segmentation masks, to an output<br>
    photorealistic video.<br>
    3.<a href="https://github.com/ikergarcia1996/Self-Driving-Car-in-Video-Games">Self-Driving-Car-in-Video-Games</a><br>
    When training an autonomous driving program, let the program be pre-trained in a virtual environment, just like simulation calculation in the engineering<br>
    field. This method can reduce the risk of testing the program directly in the real environment, which seems very promising.<br>
