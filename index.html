<h1>Hi Welcome to Critical Tech!<br>
    WEEK1 WORK
</h1>
<p>
    <b>I  Choose/find 3 less common (weird?) creative technology tools.</b><br>
    1.<a href="https://github.com/pvanallen/delft-ai-toolkit.git">Delft AI Toolkit</a><br>
    The Delft AI Toolkit provides a visual authoring environment that simplifies the use of machine learning, cognitive APIs, and other AI approaches.<br>
    2.<a href="https://color.adobe.com/explore">Adobe Color</a><br>
    A good website for color searching.<br>
    3.<a href=""><br>
    <b>II  Choose/find 3 creative technology projects.</b>><br>
    1.<a href="https://www.teamlab.art/">teamLab</a><br>
    TeamLab is an art collective widely renowned in Japan for their immersive digital art exhibitions. The collective is composed of professionals from<br>
    various fields, not only in the arts, such as programmers, engineers, mathematicians, and architects.<br>
    2.<a href="https://nvlabs.github.io/few-shot-vid2vid/">The dancing David sculpture</a><br>
    Video-to-video synthesis (vid2vid) aims at converting an input semantic video, such as videos of human poses or segmentation masks, to an output<br>
    photorealistic video.<br>
    3.<a href="https://github.com/ikergarcia1996/Self-Driving-Car-in-Video-Games">Self-Driving-Car-in-Video-Games</a><br>
    When training an autonomous driving program, let the program be pre-trained in a virtual environment, just like simulation calculation in the engineering<br>
    field. This method can reduce the risk of testing the program directly in the real environment, which seems very promising.<br>

<h1>READING<br><a href="http://opendesignnow.org/index.html%3Fp=434.html">Open design now</a>
</h1>
<p>
<b>Quote1:<br>Open design, particularly in regards to digital hardware and software heralds new possibilities for artists, scholars and interested citizens to engage more fully in a simultaneously conceptual and material<br>
   critique of technologies and information systems in society.</b><br>
   Open design makes it possible that everyone becomes a source of information. On platforms like Ins, Twitter, and YouTube, we are both viewers and creators. We can fully discuss the impact of society, technology, and<br>
   products. For example, we can watch technology bloggersâ€™ evaluations of new products (mainly computers, mobile phones, etc.). They do not represent traditional, official opinions. Their influence is increasing, and<br>
   designers will also refer to their views, which increases the design participation. In the design of some software systems, even developers will use the form of public voting to lead their design imporvement.<br>
   A representative example is the design of game.Many game developers directly adopt the player's suggestions, or directly let the player design certain content.<br><br>
<b>Quote2:<br>Critical design is related to haute couture, concept cars, design propaganda, and visions of the future, but its purpose is not to present the dreams of industry, attract new business, anticipate new trends<br>
   or test the market. Its purpose is to stimulate discussion and debate amongst designers, industry and the public about the aesthetic quality of our electronically mediated existence.</b><br>
   From my perspective, critical design is more like stimulating discussions between designers and the public about the design itself. Critical design does not seem to be designed to solve the current market needs or<br>
   commercial purposes. It is more like thinking about future problems and trying to solve them, and focuses on the alternative future and its impact to the present.<br><br>
<b>Quote3:<br>However, problems still arise, with critical making being seen as either too technical for humanities and social science researchers and students, or on the other hand, as not being technical enough for the<br>
   development of novel technological skills and products. Open design methods and tools provide some guidance and support in this regard, but more work is necessary to establish making as an intrinsic part of social research.<br>
