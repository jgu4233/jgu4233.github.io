         Space fireworks festival is a live fireworks show, which comes from the war scene in the game eve. In the game, the player controls the cannon on the space battleship to fight, and whenever the battleship is destroyed, it will release a bright explosion like fireworks. In fact, the firework show originated from the artillery show, which is a way for people to celebrate victory, and then evolved into a performance in important festivals.
         Space fireworks festival is the preparation event for Eve's Christmas fireworks show. During the live broadcast, the audience will be able to see the fireworks design from the official and the players, and vote to choose their favorite fireworks design. As the host, I will hold a spark gun in my hand, please tap ‘thumb’ in the chat window to trigger my spark gun. The more fireworks I fire, the more the audience loves the scene. I will choose the three most popular designs to join our fleets’ fireworks show this year.

         ‘Echoes in EVE’ is a live broadcast show of Eve’s critical events. It is based on EVE, a multiplayer online sandbox game, to record important battles of Eve's history. These events are all created by players, and they form the unique political ecology in this parallel world. As the host, I will try to narrate the origin of each battle and resume unique details. My purpose is to show the political ecology of Eve and compare to the real world.<br>
         My plan is to drive a spaceship through the Milky Way in the Eve’s world, using ‘echo’, which are pieces of video recording placed in a specific place in Eve, to recreate the scene of the battle. Through this live show, the audience can learn about geopolitics in Eve’s world. In this parallel world, different countries and organizations generate a new international political environment. Compared with the real world, there is a similar yet different political ecology here. The Chinese and Latin Americans can unite on the same land. The Americans and Chinese are not separated by the Pacific Ocean, they face each other and start a hot battle. This is an amazing experience！
