   <i>1.This time you stop yourself. You don’t want your inquiry to be met by a patronizing sigh of <br>
      impatience or another explanation about ship dates, Agile cycles, and continuous delivery. <br>
      Better for now to hide your ignorance. When will it be done? You are learning to accept that <br>
      the answer for software projects is never.<br>
   </i>
   I really like this witty summary. The interesting feature of code is that, like a language, it is constantly evolving. As said in <br>
   the article, software and code have changed the way the company behaves. Because of continuous updates and iterations, it is no longer <br>
   a project with a beginning and an end. It is a long-term investment, just as software companies are now using monthly payment pattern.<br><br>
   <i>2.Decades of efforts have gone into helping civilians write code as they might use a calculator <br>
      or write an e-mail. Nothing yet has done away with developers, developers, developers, developers.<br>
   </i>
   Can the code be as easy to use as natural language? Is it because the brain can automatically complete information but the code does <br>
   not have such a function? If learning the expression of code from a young age, can people use code as easy as a natural language?<br><br>

<p>
   <i>1.Instead, we focused on using appropriate, often low-tech, means to simulate and test the<br>
      experiences the proposals would engender – their aesthetics, their social effects, and their <br>
      cultural implications – with the older people in the three communities. Nonetheless, in the <br>
      course of the experiments it became clear that both technical concerns and the intellectual <br>
      challenge offered by the systems would play a large role in deciding which to take forward.<br><br>
   </i>
   In their first experiment, Reconnoitring the Peccioli Radioscape, the integrity of their test proposal was affected by regional regulations <br>
   and commercial interests, which obviously forced them to change or abandon part of the plan. But after the experiment was over, they <br>
   <i>'convinced that it would work'</i>. This made me think about how to plan my own field survey so that it has enough redundancy when <br>
   facing the variables and get the results I want.<br><br>

   <i>2.Our calls remained unanswered. People ignored the ringing phones, and if they did answer <br>
      soon hung up. With several of our team observing the phone booths we were by now targeting <br>
      directly, we realised that the phones were only answered when somebody was in the booth about<br>
      to make a call anyway.<br>
      People didn’t participate in the experiment simply because they were unaware that the experiment<br>
      was going on.<br><br>
   </i>
   The scene of this experiment reminded me of some plots in the movie. The public phone remembered that the protagonist happened to be <br>
   on the side and answered, and then a new story began. The interesting thing is that this seems to have no effect in reality, despite <br>
   the team’s efforts and some changes in settings. What if the experiment needs to be carried out without human perception? How to design <br>
   tests and processes, and what methods should be used to reduce people's perception of experiments? I also encountered this problem in <br>
   previous projects.<br><br>
   <i>3.Despite our initial trepidation, people in the area responded extremely well to the test. Smiling <br>
      and curious as they walked past, many stopped to flip through the slogans and discuss their intention <br>
      with us.<br><br>
   </i>
   Simple intervention methods can achieve good results, and people can easily perceive the designer's intention and participate in it. <br>
   The content of the slogan disturbed the designer, but the actual effect was very good. When the design is halfway through, designers <br>
   often feel confused or uneasy. Perhaps the feedback they get is beyond their control, which may lead to undesirable consequences. <br>
   Should they continue under such circumstances? In the article, the designer continued and the results were good. If we encounter <br>
   the same dilemma, is there any way to guide us to continue or change the way.<br>

   <i>1.Is a brick a prototype? The answer depends on how it is used. </i><br><br>
   I like the saying that anything can be used as a prototype or a finished product, I depend on how people look at it. I think there <br>
   are more cases of prototypes. Bricks are only finished products when they become the foundation of the building. The rest can be <br>
   considered prototypes. For example, if we use bricks to draw pictures.<br><br>
   <i>2.The paper storyboard shown in Example 4 was an early prototype of a portable notebook computer for students <br>
   which would accept both pen and finger input. </i><br><br>
   I am surprised that they have already explored the interactive logic of interactive touch screens in the 1990s, and this is almost <br>
   the same as the current operation method, which is really advanced.<br><br>
   <i>3.Be clear about what design questions are being explored with a given prototype—and what are not. <br>
   Communicating the specific purposes of a prototype to its audience is a critical aspect of its use. <br><br></i>
   Prototypes are often rudimentary and not easy to understand. How do designers ensure that the key information and functions of these <br>
   prototypes are accurately communicated? What tools are used to achieve this? It is thought-provoking.<br>

<h3>3 examples of interactive installations</h3>
<p>
   <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvIRIUHJfp0">PERISCOPISTA</a></b><br>
   <b>Interactive mist installation</b><br>
   The magical interactive installation Periscopista, a giant, misty cloud
   above the lake that could be controlled by the festival crowd . By Thijs <br>
   Biersteker and Amp.Amsterdam.<br>
   The visuals morphed according to the movements, recorded by motion capture
   cameras, of festivalgoers; the audio was an ambient bed that  <br>
   subtly changed as crowd noise picked up by several microphones increased and diminished.
   The effect was a trippy and psychedelic one that <br>
   rewarded both passive observance and active engagement alike. <br><br>

   <b>Keeping the world in balance using collective brainwaves.</b><br>
   Together with the design legend David Carson I designed an installation controlled by combining peoples brainwaves.<br>
   The better people together keep their focus, the more clean and pure the world becomes.<br>
   If they lost their focus, the world spinnes out of control into a world full of pollution, plastics waste and other environmental issues.<br><br>

   <i>1.Despite the hive-mind connotations of faceless groups such as Anonymous, the archetype of ‘the hacker’ is essentially that of an individual <br>
      attempting to live an empowered and unalienated life. It is outsider in spirit, seeking empowerment outside the terms set by the mainstream establishment.</i><br><br>
   <i>2.Unlike the open uprising of the liberation leader, the hacker impulse expresses itself via a constellation of minor acts of insurrection, <br>
      often undertaken by individuals, creatively disguised to deprive authorities of the opportunity to retaliate.</i><br><br>
   <i>3.In this setting, the hacker attitude of playful troublemaking can be cast in Schumpeterian terms: success-driven innovators seeking to <br>
      ‘disrupt’ old incumbents within a market in an elite ‘rebellion’.</i>

    Rhinoceros geometry is based on the NURBS mathematical model.<br><br>
    <b>II  Choose/find 3 creative technology projects.</b><br>
    1.<a href="https://www.teamlab.art/">teamLab</a><br>
    TeamLab is an art collective widely renowned in Japan for their immersive digital art exhibitions. The collective is composed of professionals from<br>
    various fields, not only in the arts, such as programmers, engineers, mathematicians, and architects.<br>
    2.<a href="https://nvlabs.github.io/few-shot-vid2vid/">The dancing David sculpture</a><br>
    Video-to-video synthesis (vid2vid) aims at converting an input semantic video, such as videos of human poses or segmentation masks, to an output<br>
    photorealistic video.<br>

<a href="http://opendesignnow.org/index.html%3Fp=434.html">Open design now</a><br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Quote1:<br>Open design, particularly in regards to digital hardware and software heralds new possibilities for artists, scholars and interested citizens to engage more fully in a simultaneously conceptual and material<br>
   critique of technologies and information systems in society.</b><br>
   Open design makes it possible that everyone becomes a source of information. On platforms like Ins, Twitter, and YouTube, we are both viewers and creators. We can fully discuss the impact of society, technology, and<br>
   products. For example, we can watch technology bloggers’ evaluations of new products (mainly computers, mobile phones, etc.). They do not represent traditional, official opinions. Their influence is increasing, and<br>
   designers will also refer to their views, which increases the design participation. In the design of some software systems, even developers will use the form of public voting to lead their design imporvement.<br>
   A representative example is the design of game.Many game developers directly adopt the player's suggestions, or directly let the player design certain content.<br><br>
<b>Quote2:<br>Critical design is related to haute couture, concept cars, design propaganda, and visions of the future, but its purpose is not to present the dreams of industry, attract new business, anticipate new trends<br>
   or test the market. Its purpose is to stimulate discussion and debate amongst designers, industry and the public about the aesthetic quality of our electronically mediated existence.</b><br>
   From my perspective, critical design is more like stimulating discussions between designers and the public about the design itself. Critical design does not seem to be designed to solve the current market needs or<br>
   commercial purposes. It is more like thinking about future problems and trying to solve them, and focuses on the alternative future and its impact to the present.<br><br>
<b>Quote3:<br>However, problems still arise, with critical making being seen as either too technical for humanities and social science researchers and students, or on the other hand, as not being technical enough for the<br>
   development of novel technological skills and products. Open design methods and tools provide some guidance and support in this regard, but more work is necessary to establish making as an intrinsic<br>
   part of social research.</b><br>
   There may be a way to combine social and humanities with emerging technologies. Unify humanities and technology in the same theoretical system, and use the concept of open design to deal with the changing world.<br>
   Many things can be done to reduce the barriers, for example, reduce the requirement for accessing the technology, so that non-technical scholars can quickly understand and simply apply complex technology. I think<br>
   delft-ai-toolkit is a great example to lower the level of required knowledge.
